	<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
	<p>I am an Associate Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/">Imperial College Business School</a>.</p>
	<p> Most of my research focuses on organizational economics and monetary policy.  Increasingly I draw on unstructured data sources and machine learning methods to address questions in these areas.</p>
