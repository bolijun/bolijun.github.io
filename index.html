	<p>Welcome to my personal page!</p>
	<p>I am Professor of Probability at <a href="http://math.xidian.edu.cn/"> School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University</a>. Affiliate, Department of Probability and Statistics, USTC</p>
	<p>My research focuses on theory of stochastic analysis and application to mathematical finance. For the stochastic analysis, I mainly worked on reflected stochastic differential equations and stochastic partial differentiable equations arising from physics and chemistry (e.g. Cahn-Hilliard SPDE) since I was pursing my master degree of probability in Nankai University under the supervision of Prof. Yongjin Wang. Currently I am working on <b>stochastic analysis and applications</b>, in particular, it includes <b>stochastic control</b>, <b>mean field games</b>, <b>systemic risk</b> and <b>portfolio optimization</b>. I serve as an associate editor for <a href="https://www.aimsciences.org/journal/2164-6066/editorialboard">Journal of Dynamics and Games</a>
and <a href="http://aps.ecnu.edu.cn/CN/column/column105.shtml">Chinese Journal of Applied Probability and Statistics</a> journals. I have taught courses: <b>Advanced Probability Theory</b>, <b>Stochastic Processes</b>, <b>Selected Lectures on Stochastic Analysis</b> and <b>Financial Derivative Pricing Models</b>.<!--, and as a member of <a href="https://www.acm.org/fca"> ACM future of computing academy </a>.-->
