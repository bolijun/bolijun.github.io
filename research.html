<br>(with Michael McMahon and Carlos Velasco)
<br><i>Journal of Monetary Economics (2014) 67 (October): 16-32</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>Experts on the Bank of Englandâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee differ both in terms of preferences and private forecasts.  A committee of internal Bank members significantly outperforms an individual because of information pooling, but both large committees and those that add externals appear to add little value.</small>

<p>
<br><br><small>A new model of reputation for monetary policy makers predicts that all preference types become softer on inflation over time and that this evolution is more pronounced for types that put more weight on output, predictions we confirm using voting data from the Bank of England.</small>
