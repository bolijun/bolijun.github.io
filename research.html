<br>(with Michael McMahon and Carlos Velasco)
<br><i>Journal of Monetary Economics (2014) 67 (October): 16-32</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>Experts on the Bank of Englandâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee differ both in terms of preferences and private forecasts.  A committee of internal Bank members significantly outperforms an individual because of information pooling, but both large committees and those that add externals appear to add little value.</small>

<br>(with Michael McMahon)

<p>
<small>We adopt an automated approach to measuring the extent to which Fed statements provide forward guidance versus information on economic conditions.  Overall, the former has larger macroeconomic effects, particularly on market variables.</small>

<br><i>The Review of Economic Studies (2016) 83 (4): 1645-1672</i>
</p>

<p>
<small>A new model of reputation for monetary policy makers predicts that all preference types become softer on inflation over time and that this evolution is more pronounced for types that put more weight on output, predictions we confirm using voting data from the Bank of England.</small>

<br>(with Michael McMahon and Andrea Prat)
</p>

<p>
<small>Using communication measures from machine learning, we find evidence for both the conformity and discipline effects predicted by the career concerns literature following an increase in transparency on the Federal Open Market Committee.  On balance, the discipline effect appears stronger, as rookie members become more influential.</small>
