<h2>Monetary Policy / Central Bank Design </h2>

<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393214000841"> Preferences or Private Assessments on a Monetary Policy Committee?></a>
(with Michael McMahon and Carlos Velasco)
_Journal of Monetary Economics (2014) 67 (October): 16-32_

A committee of internal Bank members significantly outperforms an individual because of information pooling, but both large committees and those that add externals appear to add little value.</small>
